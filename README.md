## Python projects:

### Project 1(warm up):
Goal: (Probability, JupNotebook, running experiments with python)
Estimated Time: 2-3 hour



From python’s built-in ramdomInt (sampling a number from [0,1]) simulate and estimate the value PI

Draw a square with side length 1, sample a point, count how many points lies within the circle
Visualize sampling process in Jupitor Notebook
See how simulation converge to the real value of PI

### Project 2:
Goal: (Image processing, matrix operation, convolution kernel on image, convoluting, pooling)
Estimated Time: 3-4 hour

Given a image apply different matrix operation
Turn image gray-scale
Blurring the image 
[1,1,1]
[1,1,1]
[1,1,1]
Sharpen the image




### Project 2.5:



### Project 3
Goal: (ML, NN, data process, Gradient Descent,)
Estimated Time: 5 hour

Implement NN layer, pooling, activation func.

TBD: need a good project?
If no GPU machine, just run Feed forward layer without training?
Simple training network. Maybe linear classifier or Perceptron?


### Project 4
Goal: (CNN, back prop, multi-class classification)
Estimated Time: 1 week + training time

Build a vanilla CNN model to perform multi-class classification)
TBD:
Dataset
Dogs/Cat
Umich’s action-actor
Machine requirement
Perhaps google cloud machine? Free $200 with student email. Need to check
UR GPU machine?
